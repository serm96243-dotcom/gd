You need to start the business process \"Registration of credit and security documentation\" for the route object \"Transaction profile\". To start the BP, you need to:\n1. Open the route object profile. The System will display the \"Transaction profile\".\n2. Then click:\n→ Start business process. The System will display the BPs configured for the current route object.\n3. Select the business process \"Approval of the Request for office supplies\".\n4. Click\n. The System will notify you that the business process starts:\nYou can view the object’s progress along the route (\nnext\n).\nIf you need to perform user actions (for example, add files to a route object, fill in certain attributes, and specify a route or a group of users to solve the problem) before executing the business process, opt out \"Show setup profile at startup\" in the BP profile (for more information, refer to\nCreating a business process profile\n), and configure the display of Start profile.",
