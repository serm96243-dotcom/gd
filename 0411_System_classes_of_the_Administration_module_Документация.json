Permissions management allows the Administrator to set up rules for the availability of information for employees.\nNo user instances can be added.\nAttribute composition\nof the \"Permissions\" type contains the attributes of the\n«Object»\nparent type and the attributes shown in the following table:\nName\nField name\nValue type\nPurpose\nRestrictions\nSystem identifier\nIDENT\nString\nStoring the identifier\nFilled in manually\nPrivilege (Permissions)  [SYS_ACC_ACE_TYPE]\nPurpose\n: a directory that stores a list of available privileges for users (access groups) in the System. The differentiation of\npermissions\nto different object types is regulated by the \"Privileges by object types (System permissions)\" type [SYS_ACC_ACE_TYPE_LINK].\nUsed to grant permissions in an \"objectAccess\" visual.\nNo user instances can be added.\nAttribute composition\nof the \"Privilege (System permissions)\" type contains the attributes of the\n«Object»\nparent type and the attributes shown in the following table:\nName\nField name\nValue type\nPurpose\nRestrictions\nMask\nMASK\nInteger\nStoring the permissions mask\nFilled in manually\nSystem identifier\nIDENT\nString\nStoring the identifier\nFilled in manually\nSecurity policy [SYS_PASSWORD_POLICY]\nPurpose\n: basic type for storing security policy data configured in the System.\nFor this system class, a child type can be created. This may lead to a System error when creating instances of the inherited type.\nAttribute composition\nof the \"Security policy\" type contains the attributes of the\n«Object»\nparent type and the attributes shown in the following table:\nName\nField name\nValue type\nPurpose\nRestrictions\nBlock user in the absence of logins to the System\nSYS_BLOCK_IF\n_INACTIVE\nBoolean\nStoring a sign of blocking a user in the absence of logins to the system\nFilled in manually. Activates the field \"Acceptable period of absence of logins, days\".\nBlock the account in case of unsuccessful login attempts\nSYS_BLOCK_IF\n_WRONG_PWD\nBoolean\nStoring a sign of blocking a user in case of failed login attempts\nFilled in manually. Activates the \"Number of allowed failed attempts\" field.\nAcceptable period of absence of logins, days.\nSYS_MAX\n_INACTIVITY_DAYS\nInteger\nStoring the number of days of no logins to block the user\nFilled in manually. The days start counting from the date of the last authorization. If the user has never passed the authorization procedure, then the date of the last activity is considered to be the date of the user’s data change.\nSet the frequency of mandatory password change\nSYS_PWD_CHANGE\n_REQUIRED\nBoolean\nStoring a sign of whether a periodic password change is mandatory\nFilled in manually. Activates the \"Password Validity period, days\" field.\nNumber of allowed failed attempts\nSYS_MAX_WRONG\n_PWD_COUNT\nInteger\nStoring the number of failed login attempts to block the user\nFilled in manually. With this option is active, after unsuccessful authorization, the user will receive a notification containing the number of remaining entry attempts before the account will be blocked\nPassword validity period, days\nSYS_PWD\n_DURATION_DAYS\nInteger\nStoring the user’s password validity period\nFilled in manually.\tThe day count starts from the last date of password change. If the password hasn’t been changed previously, the count starts after signs of the password policy activation. When this option is active, the user that has exceeded the allowed number of days without authorization in the system will get a notification when logging in.\nSign of activity\nIS_ACTIVE\nBoolean\nStoring a sign of password policy activity\nFilled in manually. Only one password policy can be active for an application. If you try to save another password policy with this parameter, the system will notify you of the presence of an already active password policy and offer to replace it.\nSystem identifier\nIDENT\nString\nStoring the Password policy identifier\nFilled in manually\nAccess group [SYS_SEC_GROUP]\nPurpose\n: the role group determines the user’s permissions to documents, tasks and other objects of the System, as well as functionality when working with them.\nThe base type is a child type of \"Security subject\" [SYS_SEC_SUBJECT].\nAttribute composition\nof the \"Access Group\" type, in addition to the attributes of the\n«Object»\ntype, contains its own attributes and attributes inherited from the \"Security Subject\" type [SYS_SEC_SUBJECT]:\nName\nField name\nValue type\nPurpose\nRestrictions\nSystem identifier\nIDENT\nString\nStoring the group identifier\nFilled in manually. The identifier of access groups cannot be repeated.\nConfigured groups\nID_174620\nCustom\nStoring access groups that the access group belongs to\nFilled in manually\nOrder\nORD\nInteger\nStoring the employee ordinal number\nFilled in automatically with the instance code.\nStructural group\nIS_STRUCTURAL\nBoolean\nStoring a structural group attribute\nFilled in manually. When an object is created by a user who is a member of a group with the specified attribute, the System checks all the groups that the user is a member of and gives permissions to groups with the attribute.\nThe set of permissions is taken from the default permissions settings for structural groups.\nCredential [SYS_CREDENTIAL]\nPurpose\n: Credentials used for user authentication in the System.\nAttribute composition\n: The \"Credential\" type includes attributes of the\n“Object”\nparent type and attributes listed in the following table:\nName\nField name\nValue type\nPurpose\nRestrictions\nLock user\nIS_LOCKED\nBoolean\nStores the account lock status\nFilled in manually.\nLast login date\nLAST_LOGIN_DATE\nDate and time\nStores the date and time of the user’s last login to the System\nFilled in automatically with data from the server.\nUsername\nIDENT\nString\nStores the login\nFilled in automatically with an option for manual adjustment. The login must be unique.\nUser\nPROVIDER_USER_ID\nObject referencing the \"User\" type [SYS_USER]\nStores the user account\nFilled in manually.\nIdentification provider\nIDENTITY_PROVIDER\nObject referencing the \"Identification Provider\" type [SYS_IDENTITY_PROVIDER]\nStores the identity provider\nFilled in manually.\nUser [SYS_USER]\nPurpose\n: storage of accounts on the basis of which the System service works (audit, evaluation of permissions and prohibitions), which allows you to work in the System under different users.\nCreation of individual access accounts allows users to authorize and log in to the System interface. The System interface will display the objects and commands for a specific user, eliminating the possibility of performing actions outside the user’s area of responsibility.\nFor On-Premise solutions, there is\nanonymous access\n(viewing and limited work in the system of an unregistered user).\nFor this system class, a child type can be created. Although, there is no possibility to configure the application type when logging in via SSO or self-registration.\nAttribute composition\nAttribute composition of the \"User\" type, in addition to the attributes of the\n«Object»\ntype, contains its own attributes and attributes inherited from the \"Security Subject\" type [SYS_SEC_SUBJECT]:\nName\nField name\nValue type\nPurpose\nRestrictions\nLogin\nIDENT\nString\nStoring the User’s login\nFilled in automatically, can be edited manually. The login cannot be repeated for Users.\nConfigured groups\nID_174620\nCustom\nStoring access groups that the User belongs to\nFilled in automatically with the \"All users\" value with the possibility of manual adjustment. At the moment of saving the changes, his effective permissions are automatically recalculated.\nOrder\nORD\nInteger\nStoring the employee ordinal number\nFilled in automatically with the instance code.\nHook tokens\nHOOK_TOKENS\nChild object of \"Hook user token\" type [HOOK_USER_TOKEN]\nStoring User tokens\nFilled in manually.
