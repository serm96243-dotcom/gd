Possible values:\nSelect by type (with filtering algorithm)\nSelect by object type\nSelect manually from the list; the calculation objects must be specified in the table.\nDynamics type\nSelecting calculation dynamics type from the drop-down list.\nObject type to calculate\nSelecting a methodology from the drop-down list. The calculation is based on the object type\nCalculation Module. Calculation profile\nand its child items. It is specified when choosing the\nSelect by type\nmode.\nObject filtering algorithm to calculate\nSelecting a filtering algorithm from the drop-down list. It is specified when choosing\nSelect by type (with filtering algorithm)\n.\nCalculation objects are entered in the table using the\nbutton above the\nCalculation Objects\ntable when choosing the\nSelect manually from the list\nitem.\nTo save the calculation run parameter, click\nin the type profile.\nNext, if needed, specify a certain start time (for more information, refer to\nCRON Scheduler\n).\nTo set a schedule to run a calculation, you need to:\n1. Create a new\nAction Scheduler\n(for more information, refer to\nRunning scheduled actions\n)\n2. In the\nName\nfield, specify the\nSchedule name\n.\n3. In the\nAction Operation Scheduler\nfield, specify the start time of the algorithm (for more information, refer to\nCRON Scheduler\n).\n4. In the\nSystem action\nfield, select\nRun calculation\n.\n5. In the\nObject with action parameters\nfield, specify the parameters to run the calculation automatically (the parameters are set as an instance of the object type; described in more detail below).\n6. In the\nSchedule valid\nfield, choose\nYes\n.\n7. Click\nto save the schedule to run the algorithm.\nThe following fields will be filled in automatically:\nLast run was successful\n: it displays the result of the running algorithm; possible values:\nYes: completed successfully\nNo: run failed\nLast run date\n: it displays the date and time of the last run.\nYou have completed a schedule for automatic running of a calculation.",
