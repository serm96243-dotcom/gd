To place the Create sublimit button outside of the main instance registry, use the\nCreate sublimit\naction.\nTo configure the\nCreate sublimit\naction, you need to:\nGo to the action registry (\nLearn more about working with the registry\n). Select the\nCreate sublimit\naction. The System will display a profile to configure a custom action.\n2. Add the required settings to the\nActions\nprofile. The general action settings are given\nhere\n. No additional action settings are required.\n3. Select the object type to configure the action for. Here you can override the action name (if needed).\n4. Save your settings.\nThe object registry will display the button configured to add a sublimit.\nWhen adding a sublimit via a button:\nA dialog box with a limit structure of all types is displayed automatically (similar to creating a sublimit from a limit profile)\nWhen creating a sublimit, the entire hierarchy of the limit is automatically formed up to the parent limit (similar to creating a limit from a profile)\nWhen creating a sublimit for a previously created child limit, the corresponding sublimit structure hierarchy is automatically displayed it means, if you select a line in the limits registry and add a sublimit, the dialog box displays the corresponding hierarchy of the sublimit structure (like in the limit profile, when you see only the structure that is configured for the selected limit profile).",
