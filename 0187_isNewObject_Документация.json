The algorithm can have the following form:\nThe isNewObject(currentObject()) function checks whether the current object instance is new to the System.\nSeveral other functions are used in writing this algorithm.\nSee more\nThe\nisNewObject\nfunction is used to determine whether the current instance of the object on which the algorithm is executed is new to the System.\nThe condition is set using\nif\nand\nelse\noperators.\nIf the current object is new.\nsequenceNextVal\nis used to return the value of the \"Current value\" attribute of the \"Auto-numbering of order forms\" object type, where the System numbers each new value.\n\"Auto-numbering of order forms\" is an instance of the System type \"Auto-numbering\" [SYS_SEQUENCE] and is created in advance.\nDepending on the conditions, the corresponding value is returned using the\nreturn\nfunction. If the current object is not new to the System, the algorithm returns the value that was calculated and recorded when creating the instance.",
