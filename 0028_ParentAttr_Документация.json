Filtering condition to select items\"\ntype.\nSyntax\nattr\nSetting\nPurpose\nattr\nThe selected attribute or its ID.\nNote\nBefore working with the\nparentAttr\nfunction, specify the parent type in the \"Object form with parameters to be used for filter (parent object)\" field.\nThen  save the algorithm card by clicking on the\nbutton, after which the attributes of this type will become available for insertion into the algorithm code.\nThe function is called from the\n\"Sources\"\ntab on the toolbar of the algorithm editor, which opens a modal window for selecting an attribute with the ability to specify the attribute type.\nTo insert a chain attribute, open the nested list of the object attribute.\nThe \"Specify attribute type\" option defines how to work with attributes of a child object type. This feature is active after selecting an object attribute. The action of the attribute is similar to working with the\nattr\nfunction.\nUse example\nFor example, it is required to filter the list of cities based on the country selected by the user.\nTo do this, in the filtering algorithm profile, specify the \"City\" object type in the \"Object type with elements to be filtered\" field, as well as the parent \"Country\" type in the corresponding field.\nThe algorithm can be as follows:\nThe attribute of the filtered type is selected by the\nattr\nfunction, the attribute of the parent type is selected by the\nparentAttr\nfunction.",
